# [+update_file] Service Structure Update

## Function File: $ARGUMENTS

Based on the information entered in the function file, update the screen structure design of the
existing structure inside /prd_screens based on the content of the function file. Write based on
thorough research and include sufficient contextual information to enable AI agents to perform
self-verification and iterative improvements.

First generate a general screen structure for the service to be created, then verify it again, and
ensure that the composition between screens is well-organized.

If there are additional screens needed, configure them additionally.

## Output

Generate independent md files according to screen composition, and create files under the prd-screens
folder according to screen hierarchy

Example:
prd-screens/home/home.md
prd-screens/home/signin/login.md
prd-screens/home/signup/singup.md
