# [+initial_file] Service Basic Structure

## Function File: $ARGUMENTS

Based on the information entered in the function file, design a complete screen structure for the
service to be created. Write based on thorough research and include sufficient contextual information to enable AI agents to perform self-verification and iterative improvements.

First generate a general screen structure for the service to be created, then verify it again, and
ensure that the composition between screens is well-organized.

List the necessary screens in order of priority.

## Output

Generate independent md files according to screen composition, create a prd-screens folder, and
generate files according to screen hierarchy

Example:
prd-screens/home/home.md
prd-screens/home/signin/login.md
prd-screens/home/signup/singup.md
